    "# Worldclim pre-process to arctic\n",

    "This demo documents the preprocessing steps we take for **Worldclim** data which is used as a\n",
    "**climate reference** in the delta downscaling process. Our downscaling tools require that data \n",
    "is formatted with standardized **units**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, source Worldclim files are global in extent, so we preprocess to reduce the data \n",
    "to just the area we are interested in, the arctic in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Source Worldclim data \n",
    "\n",
    "Source worldclim data retrieved per variable in `.zip` archives. Each archive has 12 monthly `.tif` \n",
    "**high resolution** raster files. These data have a global extent with **EPSG:4326** as the CRS. \n",
    "Additional information  on the format of the source data can be \n",
    "found [here](https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: By default we look at the 30 degree second (~1km^2) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing \n",
    "\n",
    "Before downscaling we perform 2 preprocessing steps. First we transform the data spatially. Second \n",
    "we standardize the units.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first step the extent, resolution, and CRS are determined from a raster file. We use a geotiff \n",
    "raster file with an extent covering the arctic with 4km^2 resolution in **EPSG:6931**. **GDAL** is used \n",
    "to convert each monthly raster file target extent, resolution, and CRS. The resulting data is combined into\n",
    "an **xarray** dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the spatial transformation the units are converted to the units that our downscaling processes \n",
    "are setup to support. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the worldclim preprocessing is a **TEMdataset**. `TEMDataset` objects are a wrapper around \n",
    "`xarray.Dataset` objects. Our wrapper give us a common interface to tools for clipping, saving, and loading\n",
    "data amongst others. Our intermediate data, like this arctic Worldclim data, is saved to disc as netcdf files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By convention we keep data in directories based on how much processing we have done on it. Here we keep the\n",
    "data for the arctic in a directory called `02-arctic`."
